Retail Analytics with Synthetic Data & Dashboards

This project demonstrates an end-to-end retail analytics pipeline using Python. It generates a synthetic sales dataset, computes key performance indicators (KPIs), and creates interactive dashboards and visualizations.

It is designed as a capstone-style project or portfolio piece, showcasing how data can be transformed into actionable insights.
📂 Project Contents

task_1 (1).py → Main Python script that:

Generates a synthetic retail dataset.

Computes KPIs like revenue, profit, AOV, unique customers, and repeat ratio.

Visualizes insights using Plotly (interactive charts) and Seaborn (heatmaps).
🚀 Features

✔️ Synthetic retail dataset generation (5,000+ rows).
✔️ Business KPI computation: Revenue, Profit, AOV, Unique Customers, Repeat Ratio.
✔️ Interactive dashboards with Plotly:

Revenue by Category (bar chart)

Monthly Revenue Trend (line chart)

Payment Method Distribution (pie chart)

Pareto Analysis (top customers by revenue)
✔️ Seaborn Heatmap showing revenue by month and category.
📊 Example Outputs
KPIs (console)

Total Revenue: ₹X

Total Profit: ₹Y

Average Order Value (AOV): ₹Z

Unique Customers: N

Repeat Customer Ratio: M%

Visualizations

Interactive bar, line, pie, Pareto charts with Plotly.

Heatmap of monthly-category revenue with Seaborn.

(You can add screenshots of charts here for a better GitHub preview.)

🔮 Next Steps / Improvements

Load real-world sales data instead of synthetic.

Export results to CSV / Excel / HTML dashboards.

Build a Streamlit / Dash web app.

Add unit tests for KPI logic.

Automate data refresh from a database or API.
